        <h1>To My Favorite Person üíå</h1>
        <p>
            Hey babe,
            <br><br>
            It's been one whole month and it feels like a dream I never want to wake up from. You have brought so much joy and
            happiness into my boring life in this whole month. I know it has not been that long for you to forget how we met and
            what events transpired, but you know here is a short cute version of the story :)
            <br><br>
            ‚Äú
            I met this girl and she just brought light into boring life, like the ‚Äúsun‚Äù. She is my mother's friend's daughter. She
            was visiting the states along with her mother and wanted to check out NYC. I remember the time we went to pick them up
            at the airport. I saw her in the side of my eye and she was just standing there tired and staring at two people she had
            never met before I think.I did not catch a good look at her at the airport because I was too shy. I never saw her face
            until we came home and she asked me about the shower. And dude she was really really pretty. Me who was studying and
            locked in for finals took a look at her and went WOOWW SHE IS SOO PRETTY. And for almost 5 years living in the US, I had
            not come across anyone worth being called beautiful. She was so beautiful !! At that exact moment I knew I had to wrap
            up my exams asap and head to NYC to hangout with them tomorrow.
            So the next day came by and I left for my college to write the three hellish exams hoping I could get it done asap. I
            somehow aced those exams in no time and rushed to catch the next train to New york. During the train ride I kept
            thinking about her and how fun it would be to hangout in NYC together. I wanted to spend time with her and get to know
            her better cause damm she was so beautiful. (IK this sounds creepy but I couldn't help it, you indeed are that pretty)So
            as time passed and I reached the Hotel she stayed at, I saw her get off the cab and right then and there my body went
            into shock. You see I am a very awkward person and she was soo hot I just froze for a while just staring. I still
            remember that blue sweater and the skirt she wore oof SHE‚ÄôS HOTTT. It was love at first sight for me and it was indeed
            such an amazing moment for me. Later I got to spend the whole evening with her and get to know her better. We spent our
            time walking and talking, going to Krispy Kreme and Kati roll, Rockefeller Center and Time Square. It was such a
            beautiful way to spend my start of the holidays. Later that night when they wanted to head back to the hotel there was a
            huge rush at the elevators so the aunties stayed downstairs in the lounge to relax. This gave me the perfect opportunity
            to probably ask her for her number or insta. Damn it was a huge struggle to get to their room, I had to grab my bag and
            head to my friends dorm to sleep for the night so that I could meet them back the next morning. So I went in, grabbed my
            bag and decided to head back down but I had to tell her bye. Oh my gawd I did the most embarrassing thing in my whole
            life, I GAVE HER A FREAKING HANDSHAKE WHEN SHE WAS COMING IN FOR A SIDE HUG.After that blunder I awkwardly rushed out of
            the room. When I went towards the elevator I realized how stupid I am and I also forgot to grab her insta.But i didn't
            have insta cause I was on some no social media challenge for a while with my friends. So I waited and tried to download
            insta back so I could go back to get hers. But my phone had no data and was low on battery.So just went back and got her
            number. I was pretty excited that to have successfully grabbed a cute girls number, I was soo happpyyy. So later that
            night I was able to text her on my way back. I was a lil sad that I was not able to get her insta because it would have
            been fun to stalk around heehehe.But then i worked with what I had and hoped for a better tomorrow.Little did I know
            this was gonna be a start to what our love story might be ;))
            Day two of NYC, the most beautiful day of my life!!!! I got up early in the morning and headed to meet them. On the way
            there I was thinking about how she was talking about visiting the ‚ÄúFriends Experience‚Äù , it was just going to be the two
            of us so I was really excited and looking forward to it. I reached and we got breakfast. At the Starbucks the waitress
            misheard her name from ‚Äúpra‚Äù to ‚ÄúBra‚Äù and honestly that was the funniest shit ever cause she literally was kinda wearing
            a bra as a top !! Later we started to roam around in NYC with aunties hoping they would finish the local sightseeing and
            leave us to go explore the city. After spending time till the evening with the aunties, we finally got to hangout
            together.
            This was the part of the day that changed it all. We went to the Friends Experience, Ice cream museum and lil shopping.
            There were so many moments in these places which felt like we were out on a date. She was always smiling and laughing at
            my stupid jokes and those beautiful eyes staring at me while we were having fun conversations. Everything with her at
            that moment felt so wonderful, I forgot about all the tension from my world when I was with her. I don't know how but I
            started falling for her real hard in JUST ONE DAY OF MEETING HER. Oh there was also the beanie thing we had, As it was
            raining and we were short of umbrellas I had to borrow a beanie from her. I would ask her to put it up because I
            actually had no idea how to put one. Whenever I used to bow down to her while she put the beanie on me, only one thought
            came to my head, ‚ÄúCan I just kiss her right there ?‚Äù. I honestly wanted to do it when we were together but I was scared
            of the fact that I'd just make things bad between mom and her friend if I had kissed her, so I just let the day
            continue. Then we went Shopping at H & M, because I felt really hot and sticky in my clothes that I had to actually buy
            something comfortable to wear. She also wanted to shop so we did her shopping as well. During her shopping she tried
            this one BROWN DRESS and OMG SHE LOOKEDDD SOOO GOOOD IN THAT DRESS THAT I COULD NOT STOP BLUSHING FOR A WHOLE MINUTE.
            She did not end up buying that dress which actually was really sad because that was gonna be one of the only times I‚Äôd
            see her in that dress and it really really suited her. So disappointed and comfortable dressed, I left H&M with her and
            headed back home.The train ride back home was a good time too, we really got a chance to sit down and really talk about
            all the shit that happened in our lives. But the funny thing was she just lost her ticket outta nowhere, she was
            stressed and that made me laugh a lot cause it was really a funny situation. But then I hit her with the ‚ÄúI gotchu‚Äù and
            got her a ticket. That was the end to such an amazing day. It really did feel like a date and I am usually the kind of
            guy who doesn't just gel with anyone that fast nor do I get that comfortable with a person that easy, but we clicked so
            fast it felt like we knew each other for a long time.
            During the ride back home we decided to watch a movie and go for a late night drive. I was really excited for that too
            but in the back of my head I kept thinking about how much I really fell for her and how I couldn't tell her how I felt.
            It hurt me a little cause I never experienced this connection with anyone before and now I could not tell how beautiful
            it was spending time with her. But I did not want that to spoil my mood cause we were about to have a movie night. So we
            finally decided to binge watch the entire conjuring series together. So we watched the conjuring 1 and honestly at that
            moment I could feel some tension between us and I really wanted to talk to her about how I felt, but I could not muster
            up the courage to say anything. Then we started conjuring 2 and almost towards the earlier parts of the movie, she
            spoke, ‚ÄúListen, I don't want to regret not asking you this but do you wanna makeout‚Äù, at that very moment I said what
            every awkwards person would say, something really awkward. I said‚ÄùRight now?‚Äù, I honestly don't know why I said what I
            said.But then I just grabbed her and ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Later after all that we finally opened up and apparently there were similar
            experiences from her side. I honestly was so happpyyyy at that moment. The one girl I really found beautiful also had
            feelings for me !!!!!!! So we spent our entire night talking about our time spent together in NYC and how I should have
            fulfilled a wish of hers in NYC.
            ‚Äú

            Honestly this was just the beginning to our story. I am really lucky to have met you Prashitha. I really love you and
            miss you like alottttt. It's been only one month together and I am in love with you soo much it honesty is unreal. I
            literally pick up new skills to build you this. I literally can't believe that I really have such a beautiful soul as my
            girlfriend. Everyday I wake up with you in my mind and somehow I love you more than I did yesterday. It honestly
            probably makes no sense to you but it just feels right to me. Your voice just softnes my thoughts and you staring at me
            with those pretty eyes just gives me butterflies.I really did believe loving someone would have a limit but then ever
            since you came into my life, it just keeps growing endlessly. You mean alot to me Prashitha, I really Love you and hope
